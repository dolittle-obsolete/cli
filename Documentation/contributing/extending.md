[Here](https://github.com/dolittle-boilerplates/) you can find all the boilerplates that are used in the dolittle cli tool. The cli tool is made so that it should be able to handle extending into other languages and frameworks without having to modify the source code. The only thing you want to do then is to extend on the existing boilerplates following the already existing structure.

The "dependency" configuration "language" is not formalized yet and needs to be more mature before we can document it.
