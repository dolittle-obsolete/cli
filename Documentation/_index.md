The dolittle CLI tool will be a convenience tool for developers working on the dolittle platform to quickly develop applications on dolittle.

Using boilerplates, custom templating and configuration and [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to easily and quickly setup entire applications and artifacts like commands and queries and more.

The cli tool is currently only configured to work with dolittle projects where the bounded-context.backend is configured with language = 'csharp'. The goal of the cli tool is to ultimately be language and framework agnostic. 

[Download the tool](installing)

To get the tool fully initialized and ready for use simply do this command:
```shell
$ dolittle
```
