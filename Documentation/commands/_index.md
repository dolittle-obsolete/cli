An overview of the dolittle cli commands.

Unlike most command line tools, @dolittle/cli is mostly decoupled from the commands and functionalities it can provide. It instead relies on the [Dolittle tooling platform](https://www.github.com/dolittle-tools/common) and plugins to provide the functionalities / commands. 

This mean that in of itself @dolittle/cli does not know about any commands that aren't strictly related to the CLI tool itself (like 'dolittle check').
