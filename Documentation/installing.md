The CLI tool is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll have to have it installed first.

Then simply open a shell on any platform and run the following:

```shell
$ npm install -g @dolittle/cli
```

To get all boilerplates installed, you simply then run:

```shell
$ dolittle update
```
