The CLI tool is built using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). You'll have to have it installed first.

{{% notice warning %}}
The [Dolittle tooling platform](https://github.com/dolittle-tools/common) and this the CLI needs node version >= 10.0.0 
{{% /notice %}}

Then simply open a shell on any platform and run the following:

```shell
$ npm i -g @dolittle/cli
```

Note that it is actually required to have @dolittle/cli installed globally using -g to make use of the underlying dolittle tooling system.
